# The Wall App - Concept Overview

## What Is The Wall?

The Wall is a map-based digital bulletin board that brings the organic experience of discovering posters in the real world to the digital realm. It's a platform where anyone can share image-based content - from event posters and community announcements to local photos and creative messages - all pinned to real-world locations on an interactive map.

## Core Concept

Imagine walking through a city and discovering posters on walls, bulletin boards, and shop windows - event flyers, lost pet notices, community announcements, street art photos. The Wall recreates this serendipitous discovery experience digitally. Just like real posters that weather and eventually disappear, content on The Wall is ephemeral, creating a living, breathing reflection of what's happening now in your community.
