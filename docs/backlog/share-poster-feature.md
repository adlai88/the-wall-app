# Share Poster Feature

## Overview
Add functionality to allow users to share individual posters via a shareable link that can be pasted into other platforms (e.g., Telegram, Slack). When someone clicks the shared link, they will be taken directly to the poster view.

## Current Implementation Analysis
- The app uses Next.js for routing
- Posters are displayed in both list view (`UpcomingPostersView.js`) and map view (`MapView.js`)
- The `PosterView` component handles displaying individual posters
- Each poster has a unique ID and is fetched from `/api/posters` endpoint

## Required Changes

### Backend Changes
1. Create new API endpoint:
   - Path: `/api/posters/[id]`
   - Purpose: Fetch individual poster data when accessed directly
   - Response: Single poster object with all necessary data

### Frontend Changes
1. UI Updates:
   - Add share button to `PosterView` component
   - Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality
   - Add visual feedback when link is copied

2. New Components:
   - Create direct link page component
   - Handle loading states and error cases
   - Implement fallback UI for deleted/unavailable posters

3. URL Structure:
   - Format: `https://[domain]/poster/[id]`
   - Example: `https://thewall.app/poster/123`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Setup
1. Create new API endpoint for individual posters
2. Add error handling for non-existent posters
3. Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed posters

### Phase 2: Frontend Development
1. Add share button to PosterView
2. Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality
3. Create direct link page component
4. Add loading and error states

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement
1. Test share functionality across different platforms
2. Verify direct link behavior
3. Implement analytics for shared links
4. Add error tracking

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Implement caching for individual poster endpoints
- Optimize image loading for shared links
- Consider implementing preloading for shared content

### Security
- Validate poster IDs to prevent enumeration attacks
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Consider adding expiration for shared links if needed

### User Experience
- Provide clear feedback when link is copied
- Show loading states while poster data is being fetched
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Implement fallback UI for deleted/unavailable posters

## Estimated Timeline
- Backend changes: ~1 hour
- Frontend changes: ~2-3 hours
- Testing and refinement: ~1 hour
- Total: ~4-5 hours

## Future Enhancements
1. Add social media sharing buttons
2. Implement link preview metadata
3. Add tracking for shared links
4. Create QR codes for shared posters
5. Add expiration dates for shared links

## Dependencies
- Next.js routing system
- Clipboard API
- Existing poster data structure
- API endpoints

## Notes
- Ensure shareable links work in both development and production
- Consider implementing link preview metadata for better sharing experience
- May need to update SEO handling for individual poster pages
